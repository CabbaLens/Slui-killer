# Slui-killer
Stops the windows is not genuine popup

There are 2 versions of slui killer, notinvisible.exe and invisible.exe. 

notinvisible.exe runs in a default batch window, and is visible in the taskbar, ect.

invisible.exe runs but is invisible, the only messages you will get is when it starts up and when it finds slui. 

I'd reccomend putting this in your startup folder, because this doesn't do it for you.
