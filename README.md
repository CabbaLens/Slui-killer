# Slui-killer
Stops the windows is not genuine popup

There are 2 versions of slui killer, not invisible and invisible

not invisible runs in a default batch window, and is visible in the taskbar, ect.

invisible runs but is invisible, the only message you will get is when it finds slui. (pops up for 5 seconds)

I'd reccomend putting this in your startup folder, because this doesn't do it for you.

Works on Windows 7 Professional Version 6.1 (Build 6501: Service Pack 1)
